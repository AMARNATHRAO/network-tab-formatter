This project focuses on building and optimizing backend solutions to deploy Machine Learning ML Research: ML Demos Data Annotation Tools Data Visualization ToolsExperience with Python and optimizing deployments using Docker, AWS is a strong requirement. Familiarity with ML ecosystem e.g. PyTorch and ML Model serving e.g. Torchserve will be helpful for the role, but is not required.Job Responsibilities: Engage with the project development team early on to seek a deeper appreciation of the teams goals. Analyze needs and requirements to determine feasibility of fulfilling requirements within time and cost constraints. Coordinate with frontend research teams to clarify backend requirements for the final designs. Understand, then extend or replace existing implementations. Design, develop, and iterate on middletier and backend solutions for the final product.Skills: Experience in software design and development Experience with Python Experience optimizing Python services for deployment. Experience with Docker and AWS. Strong communication and problem solving skills Some understanding of Machine Learning would be helpfulEducationExperience: Bachelors degree in a technical field such as computer science, computer engineering or related field required Key Projects: This role will involve several 13 month projects to build and deploy backend solutions for research teams at Facebook AI Research. Projects may include video annotation tools, AI Demos, data collection tasks for images, video or simulation environments. Engineers should be very comfortable with Python, Docker and AWS in general.Task breakdown: Working on GitHub repos sometimes locally on their personal computer and sometimes on the FAIR Cluster Engage with the project development team early on to seek a deeper appreciation of the teams goals. Analyze needs and requirements to determine feasibility of fulfilling requirements within time and cost constraints. Coordinate with frontend and research teams, if applicable, to clarify backend requirements for the final designs. Understand, then extend or replace existing implementations.
